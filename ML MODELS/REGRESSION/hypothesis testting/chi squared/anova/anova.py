# # Activity: Hypothesis testing with Python

# ## **Introduction**
# 

# As you've been learning, analysis of variance (commonly called ANOVA) is a group of statistical techniques that test the difference of means among three or more groups. It's a powerful tool for determining whether population means are different across groups and for answering a wide range of business questions.
# 
# In this activity, you are a data professional working with historical marketing promotion data. You will use the data to run a one-way ANOVA and a post hoc ANOVA test. Then, you will communicate your results to stakeholders. These experiences will help you make more confident recommendations in a professional setting. 
# 
# In your dataset, each row corresponds to an independent marketing promotion, where your business uses TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions to increase sales. You have previously provided insights about how different promotion types affect sales; now stakeholders want to know if sales are significantly different among various TV and influencer promotion types.
# 
# To address this request, a one-way ANOVA test will enable you to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in sales among groups. This includes:
# * Using plots and descriptive statistics to select a categorical independent variable
# * Creating and fitting a linear regression model with the selected categorical independent variable
# * Checking model assumptions
# * Performing and interpreting a one-way ANOVA test
# * Comparing pairs of groups using an ANOVA post hoc test
# * Interpreting model outputs and communicating the results to nontechnical stakeholders

# ## **Step 1: Imports** 
# 

# Import pandas, pyplot from matplotlib, seaborn, api from statsmodels, ols from statsmodels.formula.api, and pairwise_tukeyhsd from statsmodels.stats.multicomp.

# In[ ]:


# Import libraries and packages.

# ## **Step 2: Data exploration** 
# 

# First, use a boxplot to determine how `Sales` vary based on the `TV` promotion budget category.

# In[ ]:


# Create a boxplot with TV and Sales.

### YOUR CODE HERE ### 


# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# There is a function in the `seaborn` library that creates a boxplot showing the distribution of a variable across multiple groups.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Use the `boxplot()` function from `seaborn`.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Use `TV` as the `x` argument, `Sales` as the `y` argument, and `data` as the `data` argument.
# 
# </details>

# **Question:** Is there variation in `Sales` based off the `TV` promotion budget?

# ### Remove missing data
# 
# You may recall from prior labs that this dataset contains rows with missing values. To correct this, drop these rows. Then, confirm the data contains no missing values.

# In[ ]:


# Drop rows that contain missing data and update the DataFrame.

### YOUR CODE HERE ### 


# Confirm the data contains no missing values.

### YOUR CODE HERE ### 


# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# There is a `pandas` function that removes missing values.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# The `dropna()` function removes missing values from an object (e.g., DataFrame).
# 
# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Verify the data is updated properly after the rows containing missing data are dropped.
# 
# </details>

# ## **Step 3: Model building** 
# 

# Fit a linear regression model that predicts `Sales` using one of the independent categorical variables in `data`. Refer to your previous code for defining and fitting a linear regression model.

# In[ ]:


# Define the OLS formula.

### YOUR CODE HERE ### 


# Create an OLS model.

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

# Display the model results.

### YOUR CODE HERE ### 


# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Refer to code you've written to fit linear regression models.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Use the `ols()` function from `statsmodels.formula.api`, which creates a model from a formula and DataFrame, to create an OLS model.
# 
# </details>
# 

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Use `C()` around the variable name in the ols formula to indicate a variable is categorical.
#     
# Be sure the variable string names exactly match the column names in `data`.
# 
# </details>

# **Question:** Which categorical variable did you choose for the model? Why?

# [Write your response here. Double-click (or enter) to edit.]

# ### Check model assumptions

# Now, check the four linear regression assumptions are upheld for your model.

# **Question:** Is the linearity assumption met?

# [Write your response here. Double-click (or enter) to edit.]

# The independent observation assumption states that each observation in the dataset is independent. As each marketing promotion (row) is independent from one another, the independence assumption is not violated.

# Next, verify that the normality assumption is upheld for the model.

# In[ ]:


# Calculate the residuals.

### YOUR CODE HERE ### 


# Create a histogram with the residuals. 

### YOUR CODE HERE ### 


# Create a QQ plot of the residuals.

# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Use `model.resid` to get the residuals from a fit model called `model`.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# For the histogram, pass the residuals as the first argument in the `seaborn` `histplot()` function.
#     
# For the QQ-plot, pass the residuals as the first argument in the `statsmodels` `qqplot()` function.
# 
# </details>

# **Question:** Is the normality assumption met?

# [Write your response here. Double-click (or enter) to edit.]

# Now, verify the constant variance (homoscedasticity) assumption is met for this model.

# In[ ]:


# Create a scatter plot with the fitted values from the model and the residuals.

### YOUR CODE HERE ### 


# Add a line at y = 0 to visualize the variance of residuals above and below 0.

### YOUR CODE HERE ### 


# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Access the fitted values from the model object fit earlier.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# Use `model.fittedvalues` to get the fitted values from the fit model called `model`.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# 
# Call the `scatterplot()` function from the `seaborn` library and pass in the fitted values and residuals.

# Use the `pairwise_tukeyhsd()` function from `statsmodels.stats.multicomp`.
# 
# </details>

# <details>
# <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>
# 
# The `endog` argument in `pairwise_tukeyhsd` indicates which variable is being compared across groups (i.e., `Sales`). The `groups` argument in `pairwise_tukeyhsd` tells the function which variable holds the group you’re interested in reviewing.
